# Diabetes Detection Streamlit App

This project is a machine learning application built with Streamlit to predict diabetes based on input features. It uses a trained model and allows users to input data via a web interface to get a prediction.

## Features
- Simple web interface to input data and get predictions.
- Built using Streamlit for the front end and Scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Barath-BB/diabetes-detection-streamlit.git

Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
bash
Copy
Edit
cd diabetes-detection-streamlit

Step 3: Install the required dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Step 4: Run the Streamlit app
bash
Copy
